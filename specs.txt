what is lacking?  

1: about page needs polish and finalization
    does dad want to add contact info? ask him
    is the text good? can be changed later
    is the design satisfactory? look at other examples

2: website needs to be responsive

3: accessability features need to be looked after

4: portfolio page for dads works
    portfolio page will be the biggest page in the website, allowing users to see dads works and text about the works

5: contact page? if dad wants it ill add it

6: news page? will neeed to be regularly updated
